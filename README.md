# 🔌 Arduino Playground – Embedded Systems Practice Journey  

Welcome to my **Arduino Playground** 🎉  
This repository is my personal log of experimenting, coding, and building projects while learning **Arduino Uno** and **Embedded Systems concepts**. 🚀  

Not a strict day-to-day challenge, but a **collection of practical codes, mini-projects, and experiments** that showcase my journey in mastering embedded programming.  

---

## 📅 Learning Journey  

- 📍 **Start Date:** August 2025  
- ⏱ **Duration:** Ongoing (updated as I learn & build)  
- 🧠 **Goal:** Strengthen fundamentals of embedded systems and hands-on Arduino coding  
- 💡 **Focus Areas:**  
  - Digital & Analog I/O  
  - Sensors & Actuators  
  - Displays & Communication Protocols  
  - IoT & Wireless Modules  
  - Real-world Mini Projects  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- ⚡ **Board:** Arduino Uno (and sometimes ESP32)  
- 💻 **IDE:** Arduino IDE / PlatformIO (VS Code)  
- 🔧 **Tools:** Breadboard, Sensors, Relays, Displays, IoT Modules  
- ✅ **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  

---

## 🚀 Why This Repo?  

- To **practice consistently** and build hands-on confidence  
- To **showcase projects** to recruiters & peers  
- To create a **reference repo** for future embedded projects  
- To bridge the gap between **theory & real-world implementation**
